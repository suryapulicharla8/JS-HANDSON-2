    <h3> 1.Calculator</h3>
    <p>Write a program to make a simple calculator using switch statement that takes operator and two numbers from user and print the result after operation.</p>
    <pre>const Calculator = (A, B, C) =>

    <h3>3.Eligible Voter</h3>
    <P>You are given an integer

    <h3>4.Find Relation
        PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
        X
         and 
        Y
         and asks you to find the relation between them. </h3>
    <p>The relationships between integers 
        X
         and 
        Y
         are as follows:
        
        If 
        X
        <
        Y
        , it means that 
        X
         is smaller than 
        Y
        .
        If 
        X
        >
        Y
        , it means that 
        X
         is greater than 
        Y
        .
        If 
        X
        =
        Y
        , it means that 
        X
         is equal to 
        Y
        .</p>
    <pre>const findRelation = (x,y) => {
        if(x<y){
          return (x + " is smaller than " +y)
        }else if(x>y){
        return (x + " is greater than " +y)
        }else if(x==y){
          return (x + " is equal to " +y)
        }
      };

    <h3>5.Find Grades ?</h3> 
    <p>Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:
        
        If 
        M
        ≤
        10
        , the grade will be 
        E
        .
        If 
        11
        ≥
        M
        ≤
        20
        , the grade will be 
        D
        .
        If 
        21
        ≥
        M
        ≤
        30
        , the grade will be 
        C
        .
        If 
        31
        ≥
        M
        ≤
        40
        , the grade will be 
        B
        .
        If 
        41
        ≥
        M
        ≤
        50
        , the grade will be 
        A
        .
        Your friend will enter his marks out of 
        50
        , and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.</p>
    <pre>const findGrades = (a) => {
        if(M<10) 
      };
    </pre>

    <h3>6.Get Value</h3>
    <p>You are provided with a table containing some characters and their corresponding values. Your task will be to find the value from the table corresponding to an input character and return it.
        
        | P or p 	- PrepBytes      	|
        | Z or z 	- Zenith         	|
        | E or e 	- Expert Coder   	|
        | D or d 	- Data Structure 	|</p>
    <pre>const getValue = (a) => {
    
    };

    <h3>7.Second Smallest</h3>
    <p>You are given 
        3
         distinct integers 
        X
        ,
        Y
        ,
         and 
        Z
        ,
         and your task is to find and return the second smallest integer among the three provided integers.</p>
    <pre>const findSndSmallest = (x,y,z) => {
        if(x>y && z>y)||(x<y && z>y){
          return (y);

    <h3>8.Check whether the triangle is Acute or Obtuse</h3>
    <p>Write a program takes takes three angles and checks whether the triangle is acute or obtuse.</p>
